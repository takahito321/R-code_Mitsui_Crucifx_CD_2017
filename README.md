## R-codes for the maximum likelihood estimates

### bfgs_search_1d_test.R 

- to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of the 1D potential model for a sample time series

### bfgs_search_2d_ca_fullforcing.R 

- to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of the 2D oscillator model with full forcing (ice and insolation) for NGRIP -log10(Ca2+)

### bfgs_search_2d_d18O_fullforcing.R 

- to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of the oscillator model with full forcing (ice and insolation) for NGRIP d18O

- Note that the fit of the oscillator model to -log10(Ca2+) is significantly better than that of NGRIP d18O. Thus, most of the conclusions of our paper are based on the results with -log10(Ca2+).
